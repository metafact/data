I pooled regresjonen, er det mange outliers ->kansjke slette for f?? bedre regresjons resultater

1. Seems that not any type of well is significant (Mkt, Oil and Wells regression type)
2. Try this http://finance.fbv.kit.edu/rd_download/ExplorationProduction.pdf Successful vs full cost

1. Regressed with annual EIA data, for Proved reserves. Significant for the overall period but not for sub-periods16*(2006-2015 and before 200)
2. 

###01.12.2016###
1.Regressed on Prod/Res for Us and Prod/Res World -> No significance (data used is Pooled frm Bloomber)

###02.12.2016###
1. Splitted into subperiods and regressed -> no significance for reserves or production for <2005 subperiod
2. OLS and assumption of Unit root for series in order for regression to be valid (see Unit Root Wiki)
